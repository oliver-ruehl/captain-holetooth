I’m Oliver, founder of Hirnbix, and I’m trying to revive my first game: Captain Holetooth — a small, handcrafted 2D adventure with charm, mystery, and a dash of candy-fueled chaos.

🌪️ The Story (Still the Same!)
Captain Holetooth’s flying ship crashes after a storm — wing torn off, he dives into a lake, and wakes up stranded in a strange land. His mission? Recover his stolen candy and find his way home.

🎮 What’s Done — And What’s Not
The game was originally built in Godot 2 (yes, that old). I’ve started porting it forward using AI-assisted tools to modernize the code and assets — but I’m hitting walls. I’m not a full-time dev anymore, and while I know game design inside out (ex-Nintendo, 49 years old, 30+ years of gaming under my belt), I need help to bring this to life in a modern engine.

🛠️ What I Need
Godot 4 (or Godot 3.5) developers who can help refactor or port the codebase.

2D artists — I have old assets, but they need polishing or reworking.

Sound/music folks — I’m composing, but open to collaborators.

QA testers — once we get a playable build.

Anyone who just wants to cheer on a solo dev trying to finish his first game.

📏 Scope (Still Small!)
Aim: ~30-minute experience. No bloated features — just exploration, secrets, charm, and a satisfying ending. I’d rather finish something than let it die.

💬 Why I’m Asking
I’ve poured heart into this. It’s not “AAA,” but it’s mine. And I’d love to share it — with your help.

If you’re interested in contributing, even a little, or just want to chat about the project — I’d love to hear from you.

Thanks for reading — and thanks for being part of this amazing dev community.
